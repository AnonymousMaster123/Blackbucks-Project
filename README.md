# üïµÔ∏è Footprinting

## Overview

Footprinting is the first and most crucial phase of ethical hacking and penetration testing. It involves gathering information about a target system, network, or organization to identify potential vulnerabilities. The goal is to collect as much data as possible without interacting directly with the target, thus remaining undetected.

## üß† Objectives

- Understand the importance and goals of footprinting.
- Learn various techniques and tools used in the process.
- Differentiate between passive and active footprinting methods.
- Recognize how attackers gather information to plan exploits.
- Explore defensive measures to mitigate information leakage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques of Footprinting

### 1. Passive Footprinting
Gathering information without directly engaging the target system.

- WHOIS Lookups  
- DNS Interrogation  
- Website Footprinting  
- Social Media Profiling  
- Public Records & Document Metadata  

### 2. Active Footprinting
Interacting with the target to extract information.

- Network Scanning  
- Traceroute  
- Banner Grabbing  
- Ping Sweeps

## üîç Tools Commonly Used

| Tool              | Purpose                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Nmap**          | Network mapping and port scanning      |
| **Maltego**       | Relationship and entity mapping        |
| **Recon-ng**      | Web reconnaissance framework           |
| **theHarvester**  | Email and domain info harvesting       |
| **Shodan**        | Internet of Things (IoT) search engine |
| **NSLookup/Dig**  | DNS query tools                        |
| **Google Dorks**  | Advanced search techniques             |

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Strategies

- Minimize public exposure of sensitive data.
- Regularly audit DNS and WHOIS records.
- Restrict metadata in publicly shared documents.
- Use firewalls and IDS/IPS to detect active scanning.
- Implement security awareness training for employees.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

- **Red Teaming:** Understanding target surface before an attack simulation.
- **Blue Teaming:** Identifying exposed information to strengthen defenses.
- **Bug Bounty Hunting:** Collecting details to find vulnerabilities in scope.
- **Cybersecurity Training:** Practicing reconnaissance in ethical ways.
